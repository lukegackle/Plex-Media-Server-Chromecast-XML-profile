# Plex-Media-Server-Chromecast-XML-profile
This profile aims to resolve audio issues with Chromecast devices, using default settings audio from Plex can be very quiet, notably when characters are talking in a show, talking can be significantly quieter than the rest of the audio (sound effects, music .etc) by removing the aac audio codec this profile seems to improve the volume.
